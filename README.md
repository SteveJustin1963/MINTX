mathematical operations that can be performed on matrices in mint code


## matrix operations: 
- **Element-wise** Operations: Performing element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) between two matrices of the same size. Element-wise operations involve performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on corresponding elements of two matrices. These operations can be implemented using simple loops that iterate over the elements of the matrices and perform the desired arithmetic operations using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
  - Matrix **Addition**: Adding corresponding elements of two matrices to produce a new matrix.
  - Matrix **Subtraction**: Subtracting corresponding elements of two matrices to produce a new matrix.
  - Scalar **Multiplication**: Multiplying every element of a matrix by a scalar value.
  - Matrix **Multiplication**: Multiplying two matrices to produce a new matrix.
     - involves the dot product of rows and columns.
- Matrix **Inversion**, Division: Finding the inverse of a matrix, which is a matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.
- **Transpose**: Computing the transpose of a matrix, which involves swapping its rows and columns.
In terms of 32-bit integer operations, transposing a matrix involves swapping the elements across the main diagonal of the matrix. This can be done efficiently using nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, swapping each element with its corresponding element across the diagonal.
- **Determinant**: Calculating the determinant of a square matrix, which is a scalar value that represents certain properties of the matrix.
   Computing the determinant of a matrix involves various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrix elements. Using methods like expansion by minors or Gaussian elimination, each determinant computation involves a series of arithmetic operations that can be performed using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
-**Trace**: Calculating the trace of a square matrix, which is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal.
   The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. In terms of 32-bit integer operations, calculating the trace involves adding the diagonal elements of the matrix using a simple loop that iterates over the diagonal elements and accumulates their values.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix, which represent certain properties of the matrix under linear transformations. Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix typically involves solving a characteristic equation or using iterative methods such as the power iteration algorithm. These methods involve repeated multiplication of the matrix by a vector and can be implemented using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
- **Rank**: Determining the rank of a matrix, which is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. Determining the rank of a matrix involves performing Gaussian elimination to reduce the matrix to row-echelon form and counting the number of non-zero rows. This process consists of elementary row operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, which can be carried out using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
- Matrix **Norms**: Calculating various norms (e.g., Frobenius norm, spectral norm) of a matrix, which measure the magnitude of the matrix. Calculating matrix norms such as the Frobenius norm or spectral norm involves computing the square root of the sum of squares of the matrix elements or finding the maximum singular value, respectively. These computations can be performed using 32-bit integer arithmetic combined with square root operations.
- Matrix **Decompositions**: Decomposing a matrix into simpler components (e.g., LU decomposition, QR decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition) to analyze its properties or solve linear equations efficiently. Matrix decompositions like LU decomposition, QR decomposition, or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) involve various operations such as matrix multiplication, factorization, and solving systems of linear equations. These operations can be implemented using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
- Matrix **Exponentiation**: Raising a square matrix to a positive integer power, which involves multiplying the matrix by itself a certain number of times. Raising a matrix to a positive integer power involves performing repeated matrix multiplications. Using techniques like exponentiation by squaring, this operation can be carried out efficiently using 32-bit integer arithmetic.
- Solving **Linear Equations**: Using matrices to represent systems of linear equations and solving them using techniques like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion. Solving systems of linear equations involves performing matrix operations such as inversion, multiplication, and factorization. These operations can be implemented using 32-bit integer arithmetic along with techniques like Gaussian elimination or matrix factorization algorithms

## DOTTIMES Element-wise Multiplication Operator

Multiplies two numerical arrays (elementwise). There are two forms for its use, both with the same general syntax:
  y = a .* b
where a and b are n-dimensional arrays of numerical type. In the first case, the two arguments are the same size, in which case, the output y is the same size as the inputs, and is the element-wise product of a and b. In the second case, either a or b is a scalar, in which case y is the same size as the larger argument, and is the product of the scalar with each element of the other argument.
