mathematical operations that can be performed on matrices in mint code


## Llist of common mathematical operations that can be performed on matrices:

1. **Matrix Addition**: Adding corresponding elements of two matrices to produce a new matrix.
   
2. **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtracting corresponding elements of two matrices to produce a new matrix.
   
3. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying every element of a matrix by a scalar value.
   
4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplying two matrices to produce a new matrix. This operation is more complex than addition and subtraction and involves the dot product of rows and columns.
   
5. **Matrix Division (Inversion)**: Finding the inverse of a matrix, which is a matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.
   
6. **Transpose**: Computing the transpose of a matrix, which involves swapping its rows and columns.
   
7. **Determinant**: Calculating the determinant of a square matrix, which is a scalar value that represents certain properties of the matrix.
   
8. **Trace**: Calculating the trace of a square matrix, which is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal.
   
9. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix, which represent certain properties of the matrix under linear transformations.
   
10. **Rank**: Determining the rank of a matrix, which is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.
    
11. **Matrix Norms**: Calculating various norms (e.g., Frobenius norm, spectral norm) of a matrix, which measure the magnitude of the matrix.
    
12. **Matrix Decompositions**: Decomposing a matrix into simpler components (e.g., LU decomposition, QR decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition) to analyze its properties or solve linear equations efficiently.
    
13. **Matrix Exponentiation**: Raising a square matrix to a positive integer power, which involves multiplying the matrix by itself a certain number of times.
    
14. **Element-wise Operations**: Performing element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) between two matrices of the same size.
    
15. **Solving Linear Equations**: Using matrices to represent systems of linear equations and solving them using techniques like Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion.

These operations are fundamental in linear algebra and find applications in various fields such as engineering, physics, computer science, and economics.
